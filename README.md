# Hi, I'm Saturn 👋

## CS @ UIC | Systems Programming & AI/ML

🎓 **Computer Science Student** at University of Illinois Chicago (Graduating December 2026)

💡 Transitioning from hands-on leadership roles into **software engineering and AI**, with a focus on building reliable, efficient systems. My background in customer service and warehouse operations taught me to stay calm under pressure, communicate clearly, and take ownership when things break.

### 🔧 Technical Stack

**Languages:** C++, Python, C, x86 Assembly, JavaScript (p5.js)

**Focus Areas:**
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Systems Programming
- AI/ML Fundamentals
- Computer Architecture

**Tools & Environments:** Linux, Git/GitHub, GDB, Modern Software Engineering Practices

### 🚀 What I'm Working On

- Implementing classic data structures and algorithms in C++
- Building tools and scripts in Python to automate workflows
- Running AI/ML experiments (models, classifiers, analytics)
- Strengthening low-level systems knowledge through assembly and reverse engineering

### 📂 Featured Projects

**High-Performance Graph Navigation Engine** (Nov-Dec 2025)
- Designed production-grade navigation backend processing OpenStreetMap data
- Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm handling 7,300+ vertices and 22,000+ edges
- Achieved sub-second pathfinding with optimized memory efficiency
- Tech: C++17, JSON parsing, STL, graph algorithms, geospatial data structures

**Binary Analysis & Security Exploit Development** (Oct-Dec 2025)
- Reverse-engineered x86-64 binaries and developed proof-of-concept exploits
- Analyzed stack frames and reconstructed program control flow
- Developed buffer overflow exploits demonstrating memory vulnerabilities
- Tech: x86-64 Assembly, GDB, C, memory exploitation techniques

### 🎯 Currently Seeking

Software Engineering or AI-related **internship opportunities** where I can:
- Contribute to real codebases
- Learn from experienced engineers
- Deepen skills in backend, systems, and machine learning
